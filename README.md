# DSA210Project
**Spring 24-25 DSA210 Term Project**

## 📌 Bank Transactions Analysis

### 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing my personal **bank transaction history** to uncover spending patterns, track financial habits, and identify areas for potential savings. By leveraging data science techniques, I aim to extract meaningful insights from my transaction data, such as **monthly expenses, recurring payments, cash flow trends, and category-based spending analysis**.

### 🎯 Motivation
Managing personal finances efficiently is crucial for long-term financial well-being. By analyzing my transaction data, I can:
- Understand my **spending behavior** and identify major expense categories.
- Detect **recurring payments** such as subscriptions and bills.
- Monitor my **cash flow trends** to improve financial planning.
- Identify unusual or **unexpected transactions**.
- Develop a **budgeting strategy** based on past expenditures.

## 🔎 Main Research Questions
### Spending & Income Patterns
- **How do my expenses fluctuate across different months?**
- **What are my top spending categories?**
- **How much do I spend on recurring payments (e.g., subscriptions, rent, bills)?**
  
### Cash Flow & Savings
- **Am I consistently saving money, or am I spending more than I earn?**
- **How does my spending change across different times of the month?**
- **What are my biggest expense spikes and anomalies?**

### Merchant & Transaction Analysis
- **Which merchants or categories do I spend the most money on?**
- **How frequently do I withdraw cash vs. use digital transactions?**
- **Are there duplicate or unexpected charges in my transaction history?**

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **personal bank transactions** recorded over a specific time period. It includes the following attributes:

- **Date & Time:** The timestamp of each transaction, useful for identifying trends over time.
- **Transaction Amount:** The financial value of each transaction (negative for expenses, positive for income).
- **Account Balance:** The balance after each transaction, showing financial trends.
- **Description:** A brief note about the transaction, such as the merchant or reason for the payment.
- **Transaction ID:** A unique reference number for each transaction.

## Key Findings from Statistical Testing

- 💸 **Weekday vs. Weekend Spending**  
  - A t-test was conducted to compare spending patterns.
  - **Result:** No significant difference found (p = 0.1620).
  - **Interpretation:** Spending is consistent across weekdays and weekends.

- [Optional] Add future tests like monthly variance or transaction types.
